# Group N CS3203-001 Project: KYPER

## Project Description
The project is a web-application that allows users to scan the barcodes of food items in stores and find out which companies are associated with the item, as well as allowing local businesses to
promote their products to users in their communities. The app allows users to create personal and business accounts depending on their needs/purposes for using the application. Users with personal
accounts should be able to create and name groups for specific businesses based on what they mean to the user, collecting all the products made by the businesses in said group. Users with business
accounts should be able to upload their business and the products they produce to the database of the application, allowing users to access it ( _this is temporaty at the moment, I am curious about
how to differentiate real businesses from fake ones_).
